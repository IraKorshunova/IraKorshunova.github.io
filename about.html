<p>I am a master student in <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/mastatugent/">Statistical Data Analysis</a> at <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en"> Ghent University </a> in Belgium. At the same time I'm finishing my master studies in Applied Mathematics at <a href="http://kpi.ua/en">National Technical University of Ukraine</a>, where I received a Bachelor degree in 2012. </p> 

<p> For nearly two years I've been doing a research at <a href="http://reslab.elis.ugent.be/">Reservoir Lab</a>. 
Mainly, I've been exploring an application of convolutional neural networks to EEG data for epileptic seizures detection and prediction.
I obtained pretty good results, which will be published in a follow-up <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction">AES Seizure Prediction Challenge</a> paper.
I'm planning to finalize this research by analyzing what convnets can learn from a raw EEG signal (previously I've applied them to sort of spectrograms). 

<p> In my free time I like playing cello. Currently, I am cellist at <a href="http://guso.be/">Ghent University Symphony Orchestra</a>.</p>

<p> My full CV is <a href="https://IraKorshunova.github.io/CV.pdf">here</a>. </p>
